## Description
The Top plugin takes a gray image and detects objects in the front of the image. The theoretical profile of the object is compared to the visable profile of the object. Points are selected for testing by projecting a line from the center and rotating in increments of 10Â° If almost all selected points correspond to visable points it can be assumed that the object is in front. The plugin uses limits for the number of positive detections and the maximum distance between the theoretical points and the visable points.

## Variables
- maximal distance of point from ideal shape
- minimum points on an ideal shape in percent

## Returns
- modified image with isolated top objects
