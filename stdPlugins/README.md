## Description
Applyai Vision plugins are a suite of python modules designed to solve common image processing and object recognition tasks. They are built upon the OpenCV and TensorFlow libraries. They share a common API. Each plugin solves one minor image processing task. When integrated and organised by a supervising application they can be cascaded and combined to create large scale image processing systems.
